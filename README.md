    DESCRIPTION
    
    - Need to make it more precise when considering the open and closing time.
    - Remember to ask Michael about the date, since an aggregation of the data is been perfomed, before I have the data.
    
    ### TODO
    Need to take off the department that we don't need in the data.
    Need to take off the 0% and round to no decimal places.


    Replace percentages in the data with the actual number of people, maybe keep both. if possible
